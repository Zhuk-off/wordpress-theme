# Installing a website on CMS WordPress

The theme for WordPress. A multi-page HTML site planted on CMS WordPress.
Stack and what I did: Installed a local server MAMP. Created a database and linked it to WordPress. Installed the CMS WordPress. Added a theme and "planted" it on the CMS. Configured the ability to change the header and logo through WordPress. Set up custom fields for phones, images, and headers. Configured the dynamic output of posts and worked with the slider on the site. Configured work with the feedback form through the WordPress admin. Created a dynamic menu. Added page templates, making the site multi-page. Configured SEO optimization for the theme with the plugin and optimized images with the plugin.
